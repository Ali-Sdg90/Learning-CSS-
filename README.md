<h1>My CSS Learning Process</h1>
<p>
    This repository contains my learning process for CSS. I've created 4 folders
    to organize my progress as I go through the materials and practice my
    skills.
</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>
    To get started, simply clone the repository to your local machine by running
    the following command in your terminal:
</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/Ali-Sdg90/Learning-CSS-.git</code></pre>
<p>
    Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the root directory and open
    each folder in your preferred code editor. Open the
    <code>index.html</code> file in each folder to see the HTML and CSS code in
    action. Feel free to experiment with the code and make changes to improve
    your own CSS skills.
</p>
<p>Happy learning!</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>

    This repository is for my personal learning process, so I'm not currently
    accepting contributions. However, I appreciate any feedback or suggestions
    you may have for me! Feel free to reach out to me through GitHub or email.
